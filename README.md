# VALORANT Agent Yoinker
A VALORANT tool for instalocking agents using the VALORANT API.

# Regions
The program will ask you for your region. The possible regions are NA, EU, LATAM, BR, AP, KR, and PBE. Type the region that you play on.

# How it Works
Agent selecting is handled via the VALORANT API, which means that this program does not mess with the game's memory or files at all to select the agent. It just sends a request that an agent has been selected when in the pregame state.

# Is This Bannable?
With all programs like this, there is no guarantee that it's safe because it's not officially supported by Riot. However, this program does not use an autoclicker to select the agent, read the game's memory, or change the game's files; therefore, it should be safe. No suspensions have been reported so far from using this program.
